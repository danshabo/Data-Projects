# 1. Kmeans Implementation : #
 This is a project where I implemented the Kmeans algorithm for clustering in R. Please use the following link to see the output properly:

# 2.  Gaussian-Kernel, Cross Validation, Spline Regression: #
In the first part of this project I implemented Gaussian Kernel Regression, trained and tested it using cross validation. Then, I created a Spline Regression curve to analyze Covid19 new cases in Israel.

##### In case the plotly plots don't work, running in R is recommended

# 3. Benjamini - Hochberg FDR Maintaining Procedure Demonstration: #
My final project in the course "Bayesian methods for large-scale inference". In this code (Python), I wanted to demonstrate how the Benjamini - Hochberg FDR Maintaining Procedure works for correcting the "Type1 Errors" we get when we do large-scale inference.
I based my work on the article "Controlling The False Discovery Rate: A Practical And Powerful Approach To Multiple Testing" (1995), By Yoav Benjamini and Yosef Hochberg.

The demonstration includes comparison between BH to some other procedures (Bonferroni, Simes etc).
